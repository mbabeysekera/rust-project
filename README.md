# rust-project

### Initializing the project

**If you are running rust for the first time, you can initalize the project in two ways**

> Create your own folder and initialize with
> $`cargo init` #This will initialize the folder with required files and directories

> Or use:
> $`cargo new YOUR-PROJECT-NAME`

**To run the project**

> Use `cargo run` #command and it will compile(and build) the code and run
